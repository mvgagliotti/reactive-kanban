    * Some examples of good practices:
        * https://hackernoon.com/restful-api-designing-guidelines-the-best-practices-60e1d954e7c9
        * POST method requests the server to create a resource in the database, mostly when a web form is submitted.
            E.g /companies/3/employees creates a new Employee of company 3.
            POST is non-idempotent which means multiple requests will have different effects.
        * PUT method requests the server to update resource or create the resource, if it doesn’t exist.
            E.g. /companies/3/employees/john will request the server to update, or create if doesn’t exist,
            the john resource in employees collection under company 3.
